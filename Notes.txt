COMSOL3DBin Notes Summer 2015

7/29/15

COMSOL3DBin has been used happily for a year. I now want to improve the
smoothing. I implemented quadrant averaging a long time ago and it made a
significant improvement in the data smoothness. Now I want to add a much more
robust smoothing using the Gauss-Seidel algorithm.

I have a non-isotropic version of Gauss-Seidel running so I should be able
to add it into COMSOL3DBin quite easily.

The basic strategy is simple. I just implement a new smoothing routine just
like the quadrant smoother BUT there is the complication of needing a secondary
array to control the process and of filling that array from the geometry. The
main effect is that the flag to turn on GS smoothing will also need to specify
a geometry file to use. Let's add that code first.'
